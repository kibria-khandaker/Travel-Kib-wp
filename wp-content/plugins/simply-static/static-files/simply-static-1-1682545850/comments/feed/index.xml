					<description><![CDATA[My mum and I did a 1-day hiking tour near Kathmandu with Joel. He is an amazing and experienced guide and above all very kind person. The hike was very nice, but what we liked the most was Joel company. We highly recommend him when going to any tour by WP Travel Engine Adventure. Also, the owner Joel is very nice and professional. Joel knows what Western travelers want and need. He is intelligent, informative and wise.]]></description>

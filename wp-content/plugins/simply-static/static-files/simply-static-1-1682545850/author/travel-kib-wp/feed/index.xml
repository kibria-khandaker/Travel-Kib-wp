<p>The travel world is about to be in full swing as the holidays approach. The news media likes to dramatize holiday travel &#8211; it seems to sell pretty well &#8211; so you are sure to get your fill of horror stories over the next few weeks. I’ll pass on going down that road, but here are a few other news and notes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Overall traveler satisfaction with food &amp; beverage</h4>



<p>This is especially true for repeat international travelers, it says. The study “describes that the primary drivers of airline selection among international passengers are past experience with the airline (40%);&nbsp;good customer service&nbsp;(36%); convenient scheduling (35%); reputation (33%).</p>



<ul><li>Just some food for thought as the bill makes its way through Congress and politics and travel converge.</li><li>It’s a simple enough reason: Too many people would use it and, apparently, the system would not be strong enough to support it.</li><li>The planes do not have the technical capacity and capability yet,” said Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian. “If we made it free the system would crash.</li></ul>

<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth.</p>



<ol><li>I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.</li><li>No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.</li><li>Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur.</li></ol>
